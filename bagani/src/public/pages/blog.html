    <p> Business cards are important! You can need them anywhere! Ensure to carry enough of them to not miss your opportunities or any potential clients in any event or meeting. You even seem prepared and professional when you are ready beforehand. It is embarrassing to converse with a potential client and not being able to share your card when asked for. 
        </p>

        <br>


        <p><strong><b>2.    KEEP THEM SAFE</b></strong></p>
        <p>Your business cards are the face of your business! They speak a lot about your brand and business and your personality too. You should keep your cards safe; it should tear or bend or have wrinkles when you pull it put to hand out to somebody. A way you can save it from all damages by using a business card case. The first impression is the last impression. Protect the cards from wear & tear to avoid making a poor first impression. </p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>3.    KEEP THEM CLEAN & CRISP</b></strong></p>
        <p>Keep your cards in tip-top shape! Nobody likes a dirty card when making a first impression. Your cards should be clean, without any ink bleeding or smudges. The business cards speak a multitude of aspects of you and your business. Keep them carefully organized in a case in a convenient place. </p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>4.    MAINTAIN ACCURACY</b></strong></p>
        <p>Your business card represents your enterprises! You have to keep the details printed on it completely accurate. This piece of paper is a conversation starter for your future prospects. They are the physical examples of your brand and professionalism. When you have inaccurate details on it, you will either scribble on it or the client will not be able to reach you. You don’t desire to have the wrong impression on your clients with wrong information. Moreover, the whole purpose of establishing a huge range of clientele will be lost.</p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>5.    HAND OVER THE CARD FACING THE RECIPIENT</b></strong></p>
        <p>Your clients are important to you! So, exchange your card making sure that the information on your card is readable without turning. It is necessary to read the details on the card and not just merely toss it in. This is considered rude in some customs. The moment of exchanging cards is important where both the parties receive, study and memorize the information on card. </p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>6.    FOLLOW INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMS</b></strong></p>
        <p>Every culture has diverse customs and beliefs; it is to be respected by all means! The customs in exchanging the business cards vary too in different countries. </p>
        <p>In China, one side of your business card should be printed in simplified Chinese with gold ink. Your business card should have the title and the necessary facts are to be highlighted. The cards should be offered by both the hands.</p>
        <p>In India, you should exchange business cards only with the right hand and you should put any university degree or honor.</p>
        <p>In Japan, business cards can be received by two hands and given by one hand. They have a ceremony of exchanging cards. Place the cards on the table in the order people are seated during a meeting.</p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>7.    KEEP THEM IN SEPARATED CASE</b></strong></p>
        <p>Keep the cards separated in a case from all your other necessary items. You should not frantically look for your card in your bag or wallet in front of your client. This will show your personality and importance of your business to you. With cards in separated case and ease of accessing it, shows your professionalism. All these points are taken into consideration while making business deals.</p>
       <br>

        <p><strong><b>8.    DON’T WRITE NOTES ON CARDS</b></strong></p>
        <p>Do not scribble on any business card! Writing anything on your business card will depict that you were unprepared, unprofessional or the information on the card is inaccurate. Business cards are treated to </p>
        <p>be equal respect as you treat the person you associating with. Write notes on them only when it seems relevant at that point in time. You can even make a mental note then and write it out later and out of sight. This will ensure your and company’s dignity in front of your potential client and get your work organized as well.</p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>9.    AVOID BEING AGGRESSIVE</b></strong></p>
        <p>Don’t be eager to hand out your card! Don’t be desperate to showcase your business card! Make sure to not give cards until asked for or seems relevant. Moreover, don’t just distribute your card to anyone anytime. This says that you don’t respect your business and company. Always wait for your card to be asked. If you don’t see this coming, ask them for theirs and then reciprocate for the same. </p>
<br>    

        <p><strong><b>10.    MAKE IT PROFESSIONAL</b></strong></p>
        <p>Design your card with all relevant patterns and colors. Put time and effort on its paper stock, font, coloring, and effects. Your card should speak professionalism and work for you instead of against you. Impress with your professionalism! Business Card exchanging moment speaks about your personality and your business (as repeated earlier). Ensure to comment on the card you receive, note the details on it.  Your card should bring your personal business in line with professionalism. </p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>11.    HANDOUT WITH TWO HANDS</b></strong></p>
        <p>Exchanging cards with two hands is a universally adopted behavior (Follow back to point 6). Giving and receiving cards with both hands shows you not only respect your brand and business but also of your prospects. This increases the value of you and your business. Hold each side with your two index fingers and thumb with the writing facing up, easier for the recipient to read. You can make exceptions when you have you are not in a situation to use both the hands.</p>
        <br>

        <p><strong><b>12.    EXCHANGE CARDS AT THE END OF CONVERSATION</b></strong></p>
        <p>Business cards are no doubted- the conversation starter, but they start a conversation after you have an interested client. Hence, exchange your card at the end of the conversation to allow them to reach out as per their need. Don’t sound desperate to give your card without being asked for! Just don’t run giving your business card like it’s a flyer for a free concert. Treat it with the utmost respect. Be smooth in creating a scenario to exchange the cards and try not sounding impolite.</p>
